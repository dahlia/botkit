What is BotKit?
===============

BotKit is a TypeScript framework for creating standalone [ActivityPub] bots
that can interact with Mastodon, Misskey, and other [fediverse] platforms.
Built on top of the robust [Fedify] framework, BotKit lets you focus on your
bot's logic while handling all the complexity of federation under the hood.

True independence 
-----------------

Unlike traditional fediverse bots that require a Mastodon or Misskey account,
BotKit lets you create fully standalone bots. Your bot runs as its own
independent ActivityPub server, free from any platform-specific limitations or
constraints.

Easy to use
-----------

Getting started with BotKit is straightforward. Create a fully-functional
fediverse bot in just a few lines of code using our intuitive API.
We've designed BotKit to make federation as simple as possible,
so you can focus on what your bot does best.


Type-safe
---------

BotKit is fully written in TypeScript, providing excellent IDE integration with
autocompletion and inline documentation. Catch potential errors at compile time
and enjoy a more productive development experience with complete type safety.


Easy to deploy
--------------

BotKit is designed with modern deployment in mind. With minimal dependencies and
a lightweight footprint, you can easily deploy your bot to Deno Deploy,
or any container platforms like Fly.io and Railway using the Deno runtime.
Support for Node.js and Bun is planned for future releases.


Rock-solid foundation
---------------------

Built on Fedify, a battle-tested ActivityPub framework, BotKit ensures robust
federation and seamless compatibility with the fediverse ecosystem.
You can trust that your bot will work reliably with Mastodon, Misskey,
and other ActivityPub implementations.
